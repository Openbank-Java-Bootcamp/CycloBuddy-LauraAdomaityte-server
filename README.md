# CycloBuddy - the final Ironhack Openbank Bootcamp project

It's an individual full stack app project where I applied all the knowledge of Java, Rest API, MySQL and React gained during the Bootcamp.


## Description

CycloBuddy is an APP orientated to cyclist who would like to know other like minded people and go bicycle riding together. Cyclists are the users of the app, they can sign up, log in, create a user profile, create/edit/delete the rides and add routes to the rides. Users can set the meeting place, date, time and a photo of the ride so others can easily decide if that ride suits their needs.

## User stories

-	As a user I want to be able to see my profile and edit it
-	As a user I want to be able to add a route to the ride so other cyclist can know the route I want to do
